    "\n",
    "## Section 1: Review of Causal Inference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course, we've learned several methods for estimating causal effects. Today we'll add **Differences-in-Differences (DiD)** to our toolkit. As we review each method, let's understand what unique advantage DiD brings to the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Randomized Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Random assignment ensures treatment and control groups are identical on average (in observed and unobserved characteristics).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key requirement:** Ability to randomize treatment assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:** Often infeasible (can't randomize state policies) or unethical (can't randomize access to healthcare).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What DiD offers instead:** Works with observational data where treatment occurs naturally (policy changes, program rollouts). We don't need randomization—we use time variation and a control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** We can't randomly assign minimum wage increases to states, but we can compare states that raised minimum wage to those that didn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Regression with Control Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Controls for observed confounders that affect both treatment and outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key requirement:** Selection on observables (conditional independence assumption). No unobserved confounders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:** If there are unobserved variables that affect both treatment and outcome, our estimate is biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What DiD offers instead:** Allows for time-invariant unobserved confounders. DiD differences them out using the time dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** States may differ in political culture, business environment, or other hard-to-measure factors. As long as these don't change over time, DiD removes them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Instrumental Variables (IV)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Uses an instrument to isolate exogenous variation in treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key requirement:** Valid instrument that satisfies relevance and exclusion restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:** Hard to find valid instruments in practice. Exclusion restriction is often questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What DiD offers instead:** Don't need an instrument—just need parallel trends assumption (treated and control would have followed same trend without treatment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off:** IV exploits specific exogenous variation; DiD exploits timing of treatment with parallel trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Exploits discontinuous treatment assignment at a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key requirement:** Sharp discontinuity in treatment + continuity of potential outcomes at cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:** Only applicable when treatment has a clear cutoff. Estimates local treatment effect at discontinuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What DiD offers instead:** Works when treatment varies by group and time, no discontinuity needed. Estimates average treatment effect for treated group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Minimum wage changes don't have a sharp cutoff—they're policy decisions affecting entire states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Matching Estimators\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Creates comparable treatment and control groups by matching on observable characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key requirement:** Selection on observables + common support (overlap in covariate distributions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:** Same as regression—unobserved confounders still cause bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What DiD offers instead:** Allows unobserved time-invariant differences between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can combine methods:** DiD + matching can provide even stronger identification by ensuring parallel trends among matched units.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use DiD\n",
    "\n",
    "DiD is useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Treatment is not randomly assigned** (observational data)\n",
    "2. **Treatment varies across groups and time** (some units treated, others not; timing of treatment differs)\n",
    "3. **Time-invariant unobserved confounders exist** (groups differ in ways we can't measure, but these differences are stable)\n",
    "4. **Parallel trends is plausible** (without treatment, groups would follow similar trends)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** DiD's superpower is using the time dimension to remove time-invariant confounders, even if they're unobserved. This makes it one of the most widely used methods in applied economics and policy evaluation."

    "### The Classic Example: Minimum Wage and Employment\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1992, New Jersey raised its minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05. Pennsylvania (neighboring state) did not. Economists David Card and Alan Krueger studied the effect on fast-food employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Did the minimum wage increase reduce or increase employment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why simple comparisons fail:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compare NJ before vs after?** \n",
    "   - Maybe employment was rising everywhere due to economic expansion\n",
    "   - Can't separate treatment effect from time trend\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare NJ vs PA in 1993?**\n",
    "   - NJ and PA differ in many ways (economy, demographics, regulations)\n",
    "   - Can't separate treatment effect from pre-existing differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**The DiD Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the *change* in NJ employment to the *change* in PA employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Causal Inference](../figures/CI_lab12_image1.png)\n",

    "**What we see:**\n",
    "- **Before treatment (1991-1992):** Both states show parallel upward trends in employment\n",
    "- **After treatment (1992-1993):** \n",
    "  - PA continues upward (blue line) - this is our counterfactual\n",
    "  - NJ employment stays flat (red solid line) - this is what actually happened\n",
    "  - The dashed line shows where NJ would have been without treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "**The treatment effect:** The vertical gap between the dashed line (counterfactual) and solid line (actual) in 1993.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** PA shows us what *would have happened* to NJ without the minimum wage increase. This is the parallel trends assumption in action.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 3: Formal DiD Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's formalize what we just saw intuitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 2×2 DiD Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the simplest DiD design with two groups and two time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $Y_{g,t}(S, U)$ represent observed outcomes, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "g &= \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if exposed to treatment } S \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{if not exposed}\n",
    "\\end{cases} \\\\[1em]\n",
    "t &= \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{post-treatment period} \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{pre-treatment period}\n",
    "\\end{cases} \\\\[1em]\n",
    "S &= \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{treatment applied} \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{no treatment}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does this notation mean?**\n",
    "- $g$ indexes groups: treated group ($g=1$) vs control group ($g=0$)\n",
    "- $t$ indexes time: before ($t=0$) vs after ($t=1$) treatment\n",
    "- $S$ is the treatment itself\n",
    "- $U$ represents all other factors affecting the outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example mapping:**\n",
    "- $Y_{1,1}(S=1, U)$: Employment in NJ (treated group) in 1993 (post-treatment) with minimum wage increase\n",
    "- $Y_{0,1}(S=0, U)$: Employment in PA (control group) in 1993 (post-treatment) without minimum wage increase\n",
    "\n",
    "### The DiD Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences-in-Differences** estimates the causal effect by:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Comparing **changes over time** ($t$) between a **treated group** ($g=1$) and a **control group** ($g=0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"differences-in-differences\"?**\n",
    "1. **First difference:** Change over time for treated group\n",
    "2. **Second difference:** Subtract the change over time for control group\n",
    "3. What remains is the treatment effect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This 2×2 DiD uses only two periods and two groups. We can extend to multiple time periods (which helps test parallel trends) and multiple groups, but we'll start with the simple case.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Parallel Trends Assumption (Critical!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In words:** In the absence of treatment, both groups would have followed similar trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formally:**\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[Y_{1,1}(S=0, U) - Y_{1,0}(S=0, U)] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_{0,1}(S=0, U) - Y_{0,0}(S=0, U)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does this mean?**\n",
    "- Left side: How the treated group's outcome would have changed without treatment\n",
    "- Right side: How the control group's outcome actually changed\n",
    "- Assumption: These two changes are equal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this critical?** This assumption lets us use the control group's trend as the counterfactual for the treated group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can we test this?** Not directly (it's about counterfactuals), but we can check if trends were parallel in pre-treatment periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. No Spillover Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Treatment in one group must not influence outcomes in the other group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example violation:** If NJ minimum wage increase caused workers to move from PA to NJ, PA employment would be affected even though PA didn't raise minimum wage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the parallel trends assumption, we can estimate ATT in two equivalent ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1: Difference-in-Means (Naïve DiD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the **change in outcomes for the treated group** to the **change for the control group**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{DiD} &= \\underbrace{[\\mathbb{E}[Y_{1,1}(S=1, U)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_{1,0}(S=0, U)]]}_{\\text{Change in treated group}} \\\\\n",
    "&\\quad - \\underbrace{[\\mathbb{E}[Y_{0,1}(S=0, U)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_{0,0}(S=0, U)]]}_{\\text{Change in control group}}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works:**\n",
    "- First term: Actual change in treated group (includes treatment effect + time trend)\n",
    "- Second term: Change in control group (only time trend, no treatment)\n",
    "- Difference: Treatment effect (time trend cancels out)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:** All four terms are **observable** in the data! We can calculate sample means for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Under parallel trends assumption:** $\\text{DiD} = \\text{ATT}$\n",
    "\n",
    "(We'll prove this formally in class notes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: Regression-Based Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the same DiD using regression, which is more flexible for extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define indicator variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "G_i &= \\begin{cases}\n",

    "**Interpreting the coefficients:**\n",
    "- $\\beta_0$: Baseline outcome for control group in pre-period ($\\mathbb{E}[Y_{0,0}]$)\n",
    "- $\\beta_1$: Time trend (change in control group from pre to post)\n",
    "- $\\beta_2$: Group difference (treated vs control in pre-period)\n",
    "- $\\beta_3$: **DiD estimate = ATT** (the interaction term!)\n",

    "### Summary: Two Ways, Same Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods give the same DiD estimate under the 2×2 setup:\n",
    "1. **Manual calculation:** Compute four group-time means, take differences\n",

    "## DiD with Control Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Our baseline DiD assumes parallel trends unconditionally. But we can improve precision (reduce standard errors) and make parallel trends more plausible by adding control variables.\n",

    "### Why Add Controls?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two main reasons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improve precision:** Controls absorb variation in the outcome, reducing residual variance and standard errors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conditional parallel trends:** Maybe trends are only parallel after accounting for differences in restaurant characteristics (ownership, location, menu prices, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The modified DiD regression:**\n",
    "$$Y_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Time}_t + \\beta_2 \\text{Group}_i + \\beta_3 (\\text{Time}_t \\times \\text{Group}_i) + \\mathbf{X}_{it}'\\boldsymbol{\\gamma} + \\epsilon_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mathbf{X}_{it}$ includes control variables like restaurant ownership, hours, location, menu prices, etc.\n",

    "**Key point:** $\\beta_3$ is still our DiD estimate, but now it's conditional on these controls.\n",
